Real-Time Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to track hand landmarks with high precision, allowing for gesture-based control without the need for a mouse or keyboard.

# Intuitive Gesture Controls:

1. Fist (✊): "Locks" the shape to your hand.
2. Open Palm (🖐️): "Unlocks" the shape, letting it float back to the center.
3. Finger Counting: Holding up 1, 2, or 3 fingers triggers seamless morphing between different complex geometries.

# Dynamic Shape Morphing: 15,000 individual particles smoothly transition between five distinct states:

1. Sphere: The default floating nebula.
2. Torus: A swirling donut shape.
3. Star: A complex 5-pointed geometric star.
4. Cube: A structured 3D frame.
5. Heart: A romantic, pulsing particle formation.

# Spatial Interaction (Lock Mode):

3D Positioning: When locked, the shape follows your hand's X and Y coordinates across the screen.

# Pinch-to-Zoom: 
By adjusting the distance between your thumb and index finger, you can zoom the camera in and out, physically "pulling" the object toward you or pushing it away.

# Status Feedback System: 
A glassmorphism-style "Status Pill" in the UI changes color and text based on whether the engine is in a locked or active state, providing immediate visual confirmation of user actions.
